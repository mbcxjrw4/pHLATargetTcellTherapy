# ðŸŽ¯ pHLATargetTcellTherapy

## Overview

This repository contains a reproducible bioinformatics pipeline for **identifying and prioritizing potential targets for TCR-T cell therapy** by integrating large-scale transcriptomic datasets from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)** and the **Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)** project.

The workflow automates the full discovery process:
1. **Data integration** â€” harmonizing TCGA and GTEx RNA-Seq expression profiles into a unified, analysis-ready dataset.
2. **Expression cutoff modeling** â€” calculating both absolute and relative expression cutoffs from normal tissues to minimize off-target toxicity risk.
3. **Tumor target assessment** â€” quantifying tumor-specific expression across multiple cancer indications.
4. **Riskâ€“benefit scoring** â€” integrating safety profiles (tissue risk categories) with efficacy metrics to produce a ranked list of candidate targets.
5. **Decision support** â€” enabling transparent and data-driven prioritization of targets for downstream validation.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Reproducible** â€” Entire analysis is orchestrated via `Makefile` for easy re-runs and automatic step skipping.
- **Data-driven safety thresholds** â€” Combines absolute max and IQR-based relative max cutoffs for robust expression filtering.
- **Risk-aware** â€” Incorporates tissue-specific risk stratification for improved translational relevance.
- **Cross-indication utility scoring** â€” Balances efficacy and safety to allow fair target comparisons across cancer types.
- **Modular** â€” Each step (R or Python) can be run independently or as part of the full workflow.

## Why This Matters

TCR-T cell therapy shows immense promise for precision oncology, but off-target toxicity remains a critical challenge.  
This pipeline addresses that challenge by systematically integrating **tumor expression patterns** with **normal tissue safety profiles** to highlight targets with **high tumor specificity and minimal normal tissue risk**.  
The approach is designed for translational researchers, computational biologists, and immunotherapy teams looking to accelerate target discovery without compromising safety.
